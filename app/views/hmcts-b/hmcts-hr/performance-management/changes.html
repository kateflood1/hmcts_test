    <h1>Changes to the Performance Management System</h1>


     <!--<div class="imageBox"><img src="../../../images/hmcts-hr/two-people-looking-at-laptop.gif" alt="Image from the event" width="300" height="200" /> </div>-->


    <p>As a result of staff feedback, some initial quick changes have been made to the Performance Management System with immediate effect (from 17 December 2015). A review of the system is taking place and it is expected that this will bring more changes in the next performance year.</p>

    <ul>
    <li>The ‘Must Improve’ rating has been replaced with the term ‘Development Needed’ and a new definition of the category has been agreed. Anyone who received a ‘Must Improve’ at mid-year point will now fall within the ‘Development Needed’ category and action plans will continue to address development needs. The ‘Development Needed’ rating also includes those employees who are being managed under the Poor Performance Procedures.</li>

    <li>Removed the separating columns for the ‘what and ‘how’ where staff are required to provide evidence to demonstrate progress against objectives at mid and end year. These have now been combined into one section to help simplify the form.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>New Performance Management Report Form (April 2016)</h2>

   <p>A revised PMR form is being introduced across the MoJ family, including HMCTS.</p>

   <p>The form has been devised as a response to feedback which asked for it to be less bureaucratic and paper-driven and more about meaningful conversations.  This revision is smaller, smarter and simpler and focuses on employee development and progress.  The emphasis is on regular feedback conversations and development discussions, and is supported by a line manager toolkit.  It also introduces the use of the Performance Management Action Plan as an informal tool to regularly and routinely record activities and progress when an individual is rated as Development Needed.</p>

   <p><strong>Note</strong>: the accompanying guidance and line manager toolkit refer to 'Improvement Required' which is used in MoJ and NOMS rather than Development Needed. This makes no difference as the guidance and toolkit apply irrespective of whichever rating term is used.</p>
