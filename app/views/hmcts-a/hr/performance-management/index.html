      <p>Welcome to the Performance Management Information Hub!  A resource developed by staff, for staff to provide up to date information, practical guidance and best practice case studies on the performance management process. The Hub is in addition to the Performance Management policy guidance documents available on My Services, but signposting to relevant pages can be found under ‘Related Links’ as you explore the Hub.</p>

      <p>As part of the drive to encourage high performance, a package of three key tools was launched in HMCTS from April 2013; the Civil Service Competency Framework, Managing Poor Performance policy, and a new cross-government Performance Management system.</p>

      <p>We are now two years in to the new process and, with support from colleagues across the business, the process has been fully reviewed (through a series of surveys and focus groups) to support continued and effective Performance Management in HMCTS.</p>

      <p>A number of themes emerged from these findings and a working group has now been established, with representatives from across HMCTS and the HR Business Partner community, to develop tools to build the capability of line managers and staff.</p>

      <p>"Volunteering to become part of the national staff working group for performance management has provided me with an excellent opportunity to contribute to improving our processes; not only as a manager but also as an employee of HMCTS.  I was able to exchange ideas with colleagues from other disciplines and jurisdictions, and engage with our staff to ascertain what tools and guidance they wanted to see to improve their understanding and engagement with our performance management process.</p>

      <p>Not only did we manage to work together to develop more 'user-friendly' tools, but we also developed a new appreciation for performance management reporting, and I really hope that our contributions will assist in changing the culture around the performance management system."</p>

      <p><strong>Lucy Williams, Trainee Legal Advisor at Llanelli Magistrates Court</strong></p>

      <p>Products will be reviewed regularly in response to feedback from staff across the business, and updates will be published on the Performance Management Information Hub as they become available.</p>
